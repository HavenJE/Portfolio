        <p>
          A junior web developer who is looking to work alongside talented
          professionals in a rewarding career in the Information Technology
          sector. Highly motivated to improve coding knowledge in both Front &
          Back-ends with a strong desire to progress through the web development
          career. I have a passion for learning and I’m currently using premium
          subscriptions to online resources such as Udemy and Pluralsight to
          learn different technologies with plans for Network, Cyber security,
          and Cloud platforms certifications. As eager to learn and gain
          experience with hands-on coding, I’m keen to join an internship or a
          Graduate program as a junior web developer where my knowledge growth
          would contribute to business growth and success.
